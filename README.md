# OpenStreetMap Animate

OpenStreetMap Animate is a Svelte web app that plays back multiple users' GPX tracks on a map, synced to their [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) edits in a video-style format. It's perfect for reviewing an edit session or visualizing a competition between users editing with [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/).

Users' edits are loaded straight from the OpenStreetMap API. No back-end necessary.
